## About The Project

Like many people, I couldn't believe it when I heard that Ukraine had been invaded by Russia, in the days and weeks following the breaking of the news information was scattered amongst several sources and became confusing.

This site was designed to combat that, by combining several information feeds into one location and simplifying/collating the key data I was able to create a site that (at least in some small degree) helped.
