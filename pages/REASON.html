        It's 5am, bleary-eyed you sit at a table in an airport waiting for a flight, the airport coffee just doesn't seem to help anymore. You take your earphones out just as the TV behind you blares to life, "Russian President, Vladimir Putin, has announced a special military operation in Ukraine, reports of missiles striking several areas of Ukraine including the capital of Kyiv are coming in now." <br><br>
        You turn around, just in time to see the first footage of a missile hitting what seems to be a residential apartment building, tearing through the mortar and brickwork before erupting out the other side, immediately turning the corner of three floors into scrap. <br><br> 
        You feel like you're dreaming.

        Like many of you, we were emotionally distressed upon seeing the footage coming out of Ukraine since the Russian invasion on the 22nd of February, innocent families and children slaughtered for seemingly nothing at all, tanks and armored vehicles roaming residential areas, missile bombardments hitting civilian areas. <br><br>
        
        We cannot sit back and do nothing.<br><br>

        This website was created to act as a central hub, a location you can point people to that allows them to easily digest information regarding the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and help if they can. We have reviewed and collected a number of key resources, detailed how foreigners can best help Ukrainians on the ground, and boiled all of it down into an easy to understand format, without noise or distraction. <br><br>

        Further to this, we have more features planned and will keep updating the site to reflect the needs of Ukraine. <br><br>
        
        We wish to arm <i>you</i>, the individual reading this right now, with the tools necessary to support Ukraine however <i>you</i> see fit, whether by donating, sharing information, contacting government and companies, or <u>any other method you choose for yourself</u>.  <br><br>
        We hope you find the resources within useful. Please act.<br><br>
        Godspeed. Slava Ukraini. <br><br>
        Слава Україні.
