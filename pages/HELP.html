        <p>The current situation developing in Ukraine can feel overwhelming at times, people are understandably worried and unsure as to how they can help at a personal level, so we've collected the most effective options according to Ukrainian outlets and broken it down for you, listed in order of priority/effectiveness. </p>

          <li class="font-semibold p-2">DONATE.</li>
          <p class="p-2">Ukraine urgently needs medical and military supplies, your donation is crucial in supporting their continued defence.

          <li class="font-semibold p-2 mt-6">CONTACT YOUR LOCAL, STATE AND/OR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT REPRESENTATIVE.</li>
          <p class="p-2">By letting your government know they cannot ignore the atrocities being committed in Ukraine, you can pressure them into acting at a level no one person can individually. <br><br> Governments are able to provide unprecedented levels of aid through sanctioning, financial support, military/medical supplies, etc. <br><br>
          You can find your government member below or on your government's website: <br><br>

          <li class="font-semibold p-2 mt-6">JOIN PRO-UKRAINE RALLIES AND DEMONSTRATIONS IN YOUR REGION.</li>
          <p class="p-2">Your presence in a large body of people under one cause sends a clear message to your government, that they must act on as your representatives. These rallies are often organised as Facebook events, we suggest searching Facebook for events under the 'Ukraine' keyword near you.</p>

          <li class="font-semibold p-2 mt-6">SHARE THIS SITE AND UKRAINIAN NEWS COMING OUT OF THE REGION FROM OUTLETS SUCH AS <a class="text-blue-400" href="https://kyivindependent.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">THE KYIV INDEPENDENT</a>.</li>
          <p class="p-2">By spreading the word you can amplify your effect, every extra person that understands the conflict potentially becomes one more person next to you at a rally, one more medical kit in the hands of a Ukrainian soldier, one more refugee given safe passage.</p>
